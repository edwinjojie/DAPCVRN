# University Module - Backend Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Deliverables

### 1. **Backend APIs** ✅

All required endpoints have been implemented in `/backend/routes/university.js`:

#### Verification Management
- ✅ `GET /api/university/verification/requests` - List pending/all verification requests
- ✅ `GET /api/university/verification/requests/:requestId` - Get specific request details
- ✅ `POST /api/university/verification/approve/:requestId` - Approve credentials with hash generation
- ✅ `POST /api/university/verification/reject/:requestId` - Reject with reason

#### Credentials Management
- ✅ `GET /api/university/credentials/issued` - List issued credentials with filters
- ✅ `GET /api/university/credentials/issued/:credentialId` - Get credential details

#### Student Management
- ✅ `GET /api/university/students/search` - Search students by name/email/degree with credential summary

#### Analytics & Reporting
- ✅ `GET /api/university/reports/analytics` - Comprehensive dashboard analytics

---

### 2. **Authentication & Authorization** ✅

#### New Files:
- `/backend/middleware/roleMiddleware.js` - Role-based access control
  - `requireUniversity()` middleware for protecting routes
  - `requireRole(...roles)` generic role checker

#### Implementation:
- Role checking for `university` and `institution` roles
- JWT token validation on all endpoints
- Returns 401 (unauthorized) or 403 (forbidden) appropriately
- Integrated with existing auth system

---

### 3. **Mock Data Models** ✅

Three mock data stores with realistic test data:

#### VerificationRequests (Mock)
```
- VR-001: Sarah Chen - Degree (pending) - Submitted 2 days ago
- VR-002: Michael Rodriguez - Certificate (pending) - Submitted 1 day ago
- VR-003: Emily Watson - Degree (approved) - Verified 3 days ago
- VR-004: James Park - Certificate (rejected) - Rejected 7 days ago
```

#### IssuedCredentials (Mock)
```
- IC-001: Sarah Chen - B.Tech Computer Science
- IC-002: Emily Watson - M.Tech Data Science
- IC-003: Lisa Zhang - Blockchain Development
```

#### Students (Mock)
```
- 5 students with enrollment info, degrees, and credential summaries
```

---

### 4. **Validation & Error Handling** ✅

#### Joi Schemas Implemented:
```javascript
✅ approveCredentialSchema - Optional fileUrl and timestamp
✅ rejectCredentialSchema - Required reason (5-500 chars)
✅ searchStudentsSchema - Name, email, degree filters with pagination
✅ paginationSchema - page, limit, status validation
```

#### Error Handling:
- 400: Invalid input/validation errors
- 401: Missing authentication token
- 403: Insufficient permissions
- 404: Resource not found
- 500: Server errors

All errors return consistent JSON format with descriptive messages.

---

### 5. **Comprehensive Test Suite** ✅

File: `/backend/routes/university.test.js`

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ 40+ test cases covering all endpoints
- ✅ Authentication tests (401, 403 scenarios)
- ✅ Approval workflow with hash generation verification
- ✅ Rejection workflow with validation
- ✅ Pagination tests
- ✅ Filtering tests
- ✅ Analytics metrics accuracy
- ✅ Student search functionality
- ✅ Detail endpoint tests
- ✅ Error scenario testing

**Running Tests:**
```bash
npm run test:university           # Run university tests only
npm run test                      # Run all tests
npm run test:watch               # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage            # Coverage report
```

---

### 6. **Key Features** ✅

#### Credential Approval Workflow:
1. Validates verification request exists
2. Checks status is "pending"
3. **Generates SHA256 hash** from file URL + timestamp
4. Updates verification request status
5. Creates issued credential entry
6. Returns both objects with hash

#### Credential Rejection Workflow:
1. Validates reason (5-500 characters)
2. Checks status is "pending"
3. Marks request as rejected
4. Stores rejection reason
5. Returns updated request

#### Analytics Dashboard:
- Total counts (pending, approved, rejected, issued)
- Average verification time calculation
- Credential breakdown by type and status
- Monthly verification statistics (last 6 months)
- Recent activity (last 5 requests and credentials)

#### Student Search:
- Search by name (partial match, case-insensitive)
- Search by email (validated format)
- Search by degree (partial match)
- Returns credential summary per student
- Pagination support

---

### 7. **Integration Points** ✅

#### With Existing System:
- ✅ Uses existing JWT authentication (`authenticateToken` middleware)
- ✅ Uses existing error handler middleware
- ✅ Follows existing route structure (Express.js)
- ✅ Uses Joi for validation like other routes
- ✅ Compatible with existing CORS configuration
- ✅ Uses same error handling patterns

#### Server Registration:
- ✅ Route imported in `/backend/server.js`
- ✅ Registered at `/api/university` path
- ✅ Protected with `authenticateToken` middleware
- ✅ Uses error handler middleware

---

### 8. **Configuration & Testing Setup** ✅

#### Updated Files:
- `/backend/server.js` - Added university route import and registration
- `/package.json` - Added test scripts and Jest/Supertest dependencies
- `/jest.config.js` - New Jest configuration for Node.js testing

#### Test Scripts Added:
```json
"test": "jest",
"test:watch": "jest --watch",
"test:coverage": "jest --coverage",
"test:university": "jest backend/routes/university.test.js"
```

---

### 9. **Documentation** ✅

1. **UNIVERSITY_API.md** - Complete API documentation
   - All endpoints with examples
   - Request/response formats
   - Query parameters
   - Error codes

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Test the Backend
```bash
npm run test:university
```

### 3. Start the Server
```bash
npm run server
```

### 4. Test Endpoints (using mock token)

**Login to get token:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "iit@dapcvrn.com",
    "password": "any"
  }'
```

**Use token to test universities endpoint:**
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/university/verification/requests" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token_from_login>"
```

{
  _id: ObjectId,
  studentId: String,
  studentName: String,
  studentEmail: String,
  credentialType: String,
  credentialTitle: String,
  status: String, // pending, approved, rejected
  submittedAt: Date,
  approvedAt: Date,
