## 🧪 How to Verify Implementation

### 1. Check All Files Exist
```bash
# Routes
ls -la bose/backend/routes/university.js
ls -la bose/backend/routes/university.test.js

# Middleware
ls -la bose/backend/middleware/roleMiddleware.js

# Configuration
ls -la bose/jest.config.js
ls -la bose/package.json

# Documentation
ls -la bose/UNIVERSITY_*.md
ls -la bose/backend/UNIVERSITY_API.md
ls -la bose/BACKEND_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md
ls -la bose/QUICK_START_UNIVERSITY_API.md
```

### 2. Run Tests
```bash
npm install  # Install Jest and Supertest
npm run test:university  # Run university tests
```

Expected: **40+ tests pass** ✅

### 3. Start Server and Test Manually
```bash
npm run server  # Start on port 3001
```

In another terminal:
```bash
# Login
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "iit@dapcvrn.com", "password": "any"}'

# Test endpoint
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/university/verification/requests" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token_from_login>"
```

Expected: Returns verification requests list with 200 status ✅

### 4. Verify Integration
```bash
# Check server.js has university route
grep "universityRouter" bose/backend/server.js
grep "/api/university" bose/backend/server.js
```

1. **Frontend Implementation** - Create university dashboard UI
2. **Database Migration** - Replace mock data with MongoDB
3. **Email Notifications** - Add notification system
4. **Audit Logging** - Add activity tracking

---

## 📝 Key Points for Frontend Dev

When building the frontend:

1. **Base URL**: `/api/university`
2. **Authentication**: Add token to all requests in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
3. **Endpoints**: See UNIVERSITY_API.md for all details
4. **Mock Data**: Available in `university.js` - 4 verification requests, 3 credentials, 5 students
5. **Error Handling**: Check response.status and response.body.error
6. **Pagination**: Default page=1, limit=10
7. **Date Format**: ISO 8601 (e.g., 2024-02-15T14:30:00Z)
