## 🔍 **Debugging Tips**

### **If no verifier found:**

**Console shows:**
```
No verifier found for institution: XYZ
```

**Solutions:**
1. Check institution name spelling
2. Use one of the supported institutions listed above
3. Try partial name (e.g., "MIT" instead of full name)
4. Check backend console for exact search query

---

### **If verifier sees empty list:**

**Console shows:**
```
Found 0 verification requests
```

**Solutions:**
1. Verify upload was successful
2. Check backend console during upload for "Verification request created"
3. Ensure you're logged in as the correct verifier
4. Check MongoDB directly:
   ```javascript
   db.verificationrequests.find({ status: 'pending' })
   ```

### **If file not accessible:**

**Error:** 404 when clicking "View Document"

**Solutions:**
1. Check if file exists in `backend/uploads/credentials/`
